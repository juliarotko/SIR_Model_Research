# SIR Model Research: Properties in Epidemiological Modeling Applications 

This repository contains my projects on epidemiological modeling with the SIR model and its versions. The first study focuses on the classic SIR model without and with demography, and explores its mathematical properties and dynamics in modeling the spread of an epidemic. The second study concerns the SIR model with stochastic effects and a spatial SIR model with metapopulation. The work focuses on simulating disease spread, analyzing outcomes, and exploring model extensions to better reflect real-world stochastic dynamics.

## Reports 
- **[Report 1](reports/report1.pdf)** – Analysis of the SIR model outcomes and exploration of the dynamics.  
- **[Report 2](reports/report2.pdf)** – Co-authored with [@Anna De Martin], focusing on stochastic and spatial SIR.

## Code 

Both notebooks contain model implementation, simulations and analyses of the given part of the study: 

- `sir_modeling_part1.ipynb` – deterministic SIR model 
- `sir_modeling_part2.ipynb` – stochastic and spatial SIR model

## Key Highlights

- Conducted simulation experiments with both deterministic and stochastic epidemiological models.  
- Applied model validation techniques to ensure reliability of simulation outcomes.  
- Visualized epidemic curves and compared model extensions to identify impactful parameters.
